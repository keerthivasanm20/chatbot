User Query:
    "I was charged a late fee, but I thought I had a 5-day grace period. Can I get a refund?"

Response Using Refined Prompt:
    Thank you for reaching out. Our billing system applies late fees if payment is not received within the 5-day grace period after the due date. If your payment was made within that period, you may be eligible for a refund.
Please confirm the date of your payment so I can check further.
